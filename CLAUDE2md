## Dev Commands

```bash
# From repo root
cd server \&\& npm run dev      # Express API on :5000
cd client \&\& npm run dev      # Vite dev server on :5173

# Tests (run from /server)
npm test                      # Jest
npm run test:coverage

# Build (Render runs this on deploy)
cd client \&\& npm run build    # Outputs to client/dist/
```

Express serves `client/dist` as static files in production. There is no separate frontend deployment.

## Architecture Decisions

### Auth

* **Session-based only.** No JWTs. Sessions stored in MongoDB via connect-mongo.
* Cookies: `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` in production, `sameSite: 'lax'`, 24h max age.
* `session.regenerate()` on login (prevents fixation). `session.destroy()` on logout.
* Password change invalidates all other sessions for the user.
* Password hashing uses `crypto.scrypt` with a random salt, stored as `salt:hash`.
* `timingSafeEqual` for all password and token comparisons — no string equality.

### CSRF

* Custom X-header double-submit pattern. No CSRF token libraries.
* CORS must whitelist only the app's own origin. Never `origin: '\*'` in production.

### Rate Limiting

* MongoDB sliding window collection — no Redis, no external service.
* Thresholds: login 10/15 min, registration 5/hr, password reset 3/hr, general API 100/min.
* TTL indexes auto-clean expired records.

### Stripe Webhooks

* Verify `stripe-signature` header on every webhook request (raw body, no JSON parsing).
* Idempotency: check `processed\_events` collection by `event.id` before processing. If found, return 200 immediately. If not, process then store with 30-day TTL.
* Never rely on the checkout success redirect to provision access — always use webhooks.

### Admin / Roles

* `role` field on User model: `'user'` (default) or `'owner'`.
* No hardcoded admin emails in env vars. Role is a DB value, changeable via `scripts/promote-owner.js`.
* `requireOwner` middleware gates all `/api/admin/\*` routes.

### Email

* Always check `emailBounced` and `emailSuppressed` flags before sending.
* Templates are plain JS functions returning HTML strings — no build step, no extra dependencies.
* Handle Resend bounce/complaint webhooks. Hard bounces and spam complaints suppress the address permanently.

### Validation

* Zod schemas live in `server/validators/`. One schema file per domain (auth, user, billing).
* `validate.js` middleware strips unknown fields before any route handler runs.
* Schemas can be shared with the frontend — define once, use in both places.

### Error Handling

* All async route handlers are wrapped with `asyncHandler` utility.
* `errorHandler.js` middleware is the last middleware in `app.js` and handles all thrown errors.
* Never send stack traces to the client in production.

\---

## Conventions

### File Naming

* React components: `PascalCase.jsx`
* Everything else (routes, models, services, hooks, utils): `camelCase.js`

### Models

* Core models (always present): `User`, `LoginAttempt`, `EmailToken`, `ProcessedEvent`, `Session`
* TTL indexes on: `LoginAttempt` (15 min), `EmailToken` (24h for verify, 1h for reset), `ProcessedEvent` (30 days)

### API Routes

* All API routes prefixed with `/api/`
* Public: `/api/auth/\*`
* Authenticated: `/api/user/\*`
* Subscription-gated: `/api/app/\*`
* Owner-only: `/api/admin/\*`
* Stripe webhooks: `/api/billing/webhook` (raw body parser, no session/CSRF middleware)
* Sitemap mounted before the SPA catch-all

### Environment Variables

* `.env.example` is committed and documents every required variable.
* `.env` is never committed.
* Production env vars are managed in Render's dashboard.
* `VITE\_` prefix required for any variable accessed by the React frontend.

### Frontend API Calls

* All requests go through the Axios instance in `client/src/api/axiosInstance.js`.
* `withCredentials: true` on every request (required for session cookies).
* 401 interceptor → redirect to `/login`.
* 403 with `subscription\_required` → redirect to `/pricing`.

### Logging

* Use `pino` logger from `server/config/logger.js` — never `console.log` in server code.
* `pino-pretty` in development, raw JSON in production.
* Log at `info` for normal operations, `warn` for suspicious events, `error` for exceptions.

## Security Rules

These are non-negotiable. Do not deviate from them.

1. Never use `origin: '\*'` in CORS config.
2. Never store sessions in memory (always connect-mongo).
3. Never compare tokens or passwords with `===` — always `timingSafeEqual`.
4. Never trust the Stripe checkout success redirect to provision access — webhook only.
5. Never send to an email address where `emailBounced` or `emailSuppressed` is true.
6. Never skip Turnstile verification on public-facing forms (register, login, reset).
7. Never expose stack traces or internal error messages to the client in production.
8. Never put the `STRIPE\_WEBHOOK\_SECRET` on the client side.
9. Never use `findById` to authorize access to a resource — always scope queries to the authenticated user's ID.
10. Always use `asyncHandler` on route handlers — never let unhandled promise rejections reach Express.

\---

## What Not to Build

* Do not add a second database (Redis, Postgres, etc.) unless there is a documented reason in this file.
* Do not switch to JWT auth — the session pattern is intentional.
* Do not add a build step for email templates — HTML template literals are the pattern.
* Do not add TypeScript unless this file is updated to reflect that decision.
* Do not add an ORM migration system — Mongoose handles schema evolution at the application layer.
* Do not create a separate deployment for the frontend — Express serves the built SPA.

\---

## Adding App-Specific Features

When building features beyond the boilerplate:

1. Add routes under `/api/app/\*` gated by `requireAuth` + `requireSubscription`.
2. Add new Mongoose models to `server/models/`.
3. Add Zod validators to `server/validators/`.
4. Add TanStack Query hooks to `client/src/api/`.
5. Add new pages to `client/src/pages/` and register them in `App.jsx`.
6. Update `robots.txt` to disallow any new authenticated routes.
7. Update `sitemap.js` if adding new public pages.
